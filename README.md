# Traffic Accidents & Tickets Analysis Project
Data Science Project for the Analysis of Traffic Accidents &amp; Tickets in Turkey

## Project Overview
* This project aims to analyze the relationship between the increase rate of traffic accidents and automobiles in Turkey over the past few years. The goal is to explore whether it is safer to drive in Turkey in comparison to the past.

## Motivation
* Since traffic accidents are one of the primary reasons of death in Turkey, I was compelled to choose this subject to have a further understanding of the reasons of traffic related incidents. The results gathered might even give insights to predict future trends.

## Objectives
* To identify trends in traffic accidents in relation to the increase in automobile numbers.
* To investigate if there is a correlation between the increase in automobiles and traffic-related incidents.
* To investigate how the mortality / injury rates of accidents have changed over time.

## Datasets
The primary datasets used in this project will come from the following sources:

1. **TUIK (Turkish Statistical Institute):**<br/><br/> 
   Yearly datas on:
   * The amount of vehicles registered,
   * The amount of total accidents,
   * The injury amounts rates of accidents,
   * The death rates of accidents,
   * The faults causing these accidents will be analyzed and stuided.

   
## Sample Data

Below is an example of how the dataset might look after cleaning and merging data from TUIK and the Gendarmerie General Command:

| Year | Total Vehicles | Traffic Accidents | Injuries | Fatalities | Driver Error % | Other Faults % | Total Tickets | % Tickets to Drivers | % Tickets to Car Plates | Licenses Revoked | Cars Banned from Traffic |
|------|--------------|------------------|----------|------------|---------------|----------------|--------------|------------------|---------------------|-----------------|----------------------|
| 2020 | 23,500,000  | 405,000          | 275,000  | 5,800      | 88%           | 12%            | 12,500,000   | 60%              | 40%                 | 15,000          | 10,500               |
| 2021 | 24,200,000  | 420,000          | 285,000  | 5,950      | 87%           | 13%            | 13,200,000   | 58%              | 42%                 | 16,500          | 11,000               |
| 2022 | 25,100,000  | 435,000          | 295,000  | 6,100      | 85%           | 15%            | 14,000,000   | 57%              | 43%                 | 18,000          | 11,800               |

This table is a simplified example of what the structured dataset might contain. The actual dataset will be more detailed and include additional variables for deeper analysis. (All the values used are placeholders to give an idea of the structure of the table)
